# DFTrueOneBlock
An incomplete [SpigotMC](https://spigotmc.org/) plugin (1.21.3), which aims to convert a normal minecraft server into a skyblock server.

## Trivia
- This plugin was the very first time I started to make proper use of classes in Java, previously everything was mostly done in the way you use other languages (because I hadn't used java before that point)
- This plugin was originally developed with the intention of including only the One-Block gamemode seen in certain custom maps. The plugin expanded in scope when trying to translate that into a server minigame.
- The original idea for having multiple worlds was to use multiverse-core to make new worlds. Unfortunately, development didnt reach the point of creating new worlds. The only feature available is the menu.

> [!WARNING]
> NOT INTENDED FOR PERSONAL USE  
> This plugin is EXTREMELY incomplete, and was originally planned for use in my server.   
> Development of this plugin ceased as I had to focus on content for the SMP, among other things.
