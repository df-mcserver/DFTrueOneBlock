# DFTrueOneBlock
An incomplete [SpigotMC](https://spigotmc.org/) plugin (1.21.3), which aims to convert a normal minecraft server into a skyblock server.

> [!WARNING]
> NOT INTENDED FOR PERSONAL USE  
> This plugin is EXTREMELY incomplete, and was originally planned for use in my server.   
> Development of this plugin ceased as I had to focus on content for the SMP, among other things.
